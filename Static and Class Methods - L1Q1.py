#Functools -> Reduce:
# At first step, first two elements of sequence are picked and the result is obtained.
# Next step is to apply the same function to the previously attained result and the number just succeeding the second element and the result is again stored.
# This process continues till no more elements are left in the container.
# The final returned result is returned and printed on console.
